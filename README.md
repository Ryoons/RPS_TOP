In this project i am going to create a rock paper scissors game using javascirpt.

Plan: 
1. ask user for choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors.
2. take input and store it to compare agaisnt computer
3. Make the computer randomly choose rock paper or scissors 
4. compare the answers 
 if (user = "rock") {
     if (computer.choice = scissors) {
         return win
     } 
}  elif (user = "paper") {

}  elif (user = "scissors") {

}
