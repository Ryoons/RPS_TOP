In this project i am going to create a rock paper scissors game using javascirpt.

Plan: 
1. ask user for choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors.
2. take input and store it to compare agaisnt computer
3. Create a function for computer that chooses rock paper or scissors
4. Create another function that takes the computer and user choice and comapares them
5. Create button so we dont need to worry about case sensitive parameters.
6. Make a game loop so the user has best of 5 chance.
